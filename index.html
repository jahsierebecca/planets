            <h3>Mercury</h3>
            <p>Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun.  It is the OG, Earth's cooler older brother. It was orbiting the Sun before the Sun got that 8.6 rating on Pitchfork. It spends 88 days doing what takes you 365 days to do. Though it orbits fast, it rotates nice and slow, taking 59 days to transition from a daytime cool to a nighttime freak. It is too hot to handle too cold to hold.</p>

            <p>At the very least you could say she's pretty. Bright and shiny. Some say second is the best, others say second is first loser. We think the jury is still out. She's definitely the hottest, teeming with carbon dioxide. And let's hope opposites attract because she's all retrograde if you know what I'm saying (counter clockwise rotation). But good luck getting anywhere with Venus. Literally, a day with her will last a year. </p>

            <p>The baddest bitch you ever met. Water. Satellite. Life. 365.25 days of awesome. The Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe (see the link above for correction). Super dense and teeming with life, Earth is definitely unique.  </p>

            <h3>Mars</h3>
            <p>Nicknamed the “Red Planet” due to its reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. There's a lot to be said about Mars, but most of our time is spent trying not to say the things we really want to say about Mars, like when will it stop being such a bitch and be a hospitable landing place for our post-Earth colonies.</p>

            <h3>Jupiter</h3>
            <p>Two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined. It has the shortest day of all the planets, but it's not about the length of the day, it is about how well you use the time. And Jupiter hasn't let those shortcomings stop it, a single storm has been raging on Jupiter for over 350 (Earth) years. Planet can hug a grudge.</p>

            <p>Visible to the naked eye (ooh la la) this planet is a shower and a grower. Let's just say there's a lot to see with this bad boy. With over 150 moons and moolets, an extensive ring set, and a polar diameter that is only 90% of its equatorial diameter, Saturn is hardly vanilla. Nicknamed “Lubadsagush” (“oldest of the old”) from the ancient Assyrians, Saturn can always play the "liked them before they were famous" card.</p>
